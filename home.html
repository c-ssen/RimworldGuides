        A substantial portion of Rimworld modding is just looking at how the base game does what it does and replicating that - at least insofar as you are interested in simple mods. These guides will not cover how to make each and every individual type of building or item in the game. Instead, they are aimed towards explaining some more technical and ambiguous areas of modding. For now, the guides available are mostly very basic, but I plan on covering more complex topics eventually.
